1. When you click on the three line icon on top right of the screen it will show you the contents of the page. I haven't   worked on them but will update that ASAP.
2. When you click the change color button right next to the bottom of first picture, wit will change the text with color light orange to the text with color dark orange.
3. In about me section, My work section and What people are saying section I've made two arrow kind of buttons which can be used to go back and forth my content.
4. In "What I'm Good At" section when you hover over the images of C++ logos or any other logo there will be an animation. I haven't decided what can I do with that thing but will be doing something creative shortly.
5. The ratings which I've given to myself in various languages are timed using Javascript.
